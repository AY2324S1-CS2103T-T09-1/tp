# User Guide 

### Welcome to JobFestGo 

**Your one-stop solution for job event planning!**

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Here’s an **overview** of how JobFestGo can help you with your event planning:
- Store information about your events and their associated contacts
- Track status of your event tasks
- Keep track of upcoming task deadlines
- Search for contacts by name or tag

Optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, it is a task management tool meant to assist you as job festival event planners in tracking event-specific tasks and contacts. This removes the hassle of having to shuffle through your contact list based on names that you might not remember and organise your tasks according to events while obtaining your information **efficiently**.

**If you are new here**, visit our [quick start](#quick-start) guide to get started with JobFestGo!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Navigating the GUI

JobFestGo comes with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for a pleasant visual experience for our users. Here's a quick rundown of what each section is for:

![GUI](images/GUI.png)

<box type="warning">

**PLEASE NOTE** : If there is ellpisis (...) at the end of a text field in any section of JobFestGo, please extend the window fully so the full text can be seen.
</box>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items not in square brackets are compulsory.<br>
  e.g. `add_contact n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS` requires the `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS` together with their prefixes(if any) to be supplied by the user.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view_contacts`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

* Contacts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* The contacts found will be based on the list that is currently displayed e.g If the current event that is selected is not linked to `Hans`, `find_contact Hans` will not have any results even though `Hans` is in the contact list

Examples:
* `find_contact John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find_contact alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`.

* Contacts tagged by at least one of the given tags will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `vendors customers` will return all contacts tagged by `vendors` and
 all contacts tagged by `customers`.
* The contacts found will be based on the list that is currently displayed e.g. If the current event that is selected is not linked to `Hans` who is tagged by `vendor`, `filter_by_tags vendor` will not display `Hans` in the result.
  
Examples:

Examples:
* `delete_event` followed by `1` deletes the 1st event in the displayed event list.

### Linking contacts to an event : `link`

Links specified contacts to the specified event.

Format: `link ev/EVENT_NAME c/CONTACT_NAME [c/MORE_CONTACT_NAMES]`

* Only existing contacts and events in JobFestGo can be linked.
* Contacts that are already linked to the specified event cannot be linked again.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `NUS Career Fest` will not match `NUS Career Fest 2023`,
  `Alice` will not match `Alice Black`
* The order of the input does not matter. e.g. `link ev/NUS Career Fest c/Alice Black`
 and `link c/Alice Black ev/NUS Career Fest` are both valid commands and will perform
 the same task.
* If there are invalid contacts in the input (e.g. non-existent contacts,
 contacts that are already linked to the specified event), the contacts entered
 before the first invalid contact will be linked while those after will not be linked.
 e.g. if `John Doe` is an invalid contact, `link ev/NUS Career Fest c/Alice Black
 c/John Doe c/Bob Dylan` will link `Alice Black` to the event `NUS Career Fest` while
  `John Doe` and `Bob Dylan` will not be linked.

Examples:
* `link ev/NUS Career Fest c/Alice Black` links `Alice Black` to the event `NUS Career Fest` if `Alice Black` is not linked to `NUS Career Fest`.

### Unlinking contacts from an event: `unlink`

Unlinks specified contacts from the specified event.

Format: `unlink ev/EVENT_NAME c/CONTACT_NAME [c/MORE_CONTACT_NAMES]`

* It functions similarly to `link` except for the fact that the input contacts and event for `unlink`
 must be currently linked. Otherwise, an error will be raised.

Examples:
* `unlink ev/NUS Career Fest c/Alice Black` unlinks `Alice Black` from the event `NUS Career Fest` if `Alice Black` is linked to `NUS Career Fest`.

### Selecting an event: `select_event`

Selects an event at the specified index from JobFestGo. The relevant contacts and tasks will be displayed.

Format: `select_event INDEX`

* Selects the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed events list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `select_event 3` selects the third event in the displayed events list.<br><br>

    ![result for 'select_event 3'](images/selectEventResult.png)

### Adding a task : `add_task`

Adds a task to an event in JobFestGo.

Format: `add_task td/TASK_DESCRIPTION d/DEADLINE ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Task Description can take any alphanumeric value, alongside hyphen, comma, brackets and full stops.
* Deadline is a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
* Deadline should not be before today's date.
* Event name should be the **name of an already existing event**.
* Reminder will be shown on the home page of JobFestGo for tasks within 3 days of the deadline.

Examples:
* `add_task td/Book Venue d/2023-12-23 ev/NUS Career Fair 2023` adds a `Book Venue` by `2023-12-23` task to the event `NUS Career Fair 2023`.

### Deleting a task: `delete_task`

Deletes the task specified by the task description from its associated event in JobFestGo.

<box type="warning">
**WARNING**: This command is destructive. Once a task is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
</box>

Format: `delete_task td/TASK_DESCRIPTION ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Deletes the task specified by the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` from the event specified by the `EVENT_NAME` of JobFestGo.
* Both the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` and the `EVENT_NAME` are case-insensitive.
 e.g. `delete_task td/Book Venue ev/NUS Career Fair 2023` and `delete_task td/book venue ev/nus Career FAIR 2023`
 will perform the same operation.
* Errors will be raised if the specified event does not exist or the event does not have the specified task.
 If such situation happens, you may double-check the task description and the event name and re-enter valid inputs.

Examples:
* `delete_task td/Book Venue ev/NUS Career Fair 2023` deletes task `Book Venue` from the task list of the event `NUS Career Fair 2023`.

### Marking a task: `mark_task`

Marks the task specified by the task description and its associated event name in JobFestGo as completed.

Format: `mark_task td/TASK_DESCRIPTION ev/EVENT_NAME`

* Marks the task specified by the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` from the event specified by the `EVENT_NAME` of JobFestGo as completed.
 A label indicating the status of the task will be shown next to its description in the task list.
* Both the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` and the `EVENT_NAME` are case-insensitive.
  e.g. `mark_task td/Book Venue ev/NUS Career Fair 2023` and `mark_task td/book venue ev/nus Career FAIR 2023`
  will perform the same operation.
* Errors will be raised if the specified event does not exist or the event does not have the specified task.
  If such situation happens, you may double-check the task description and the event name and re-enter valid inputs.
* Errors will also be raised if the specified task has already been marked as completed.

Examples:
* `mark_task td/Book Venue ev/NUS Career Fair 2023` marks the task `Book Venue` from the task list of the event `NUS Career Fair 2023` as completed.<br><br>

    ![result for 'mark_task'](images/markTaskResult.png)

### Unmarking a task: `unmark_task`

Marks the task specified by the task description and its associated event name in JobFestGo as not completed.

Format: `unmark_task td/TASK_DESCRIPTION ev/EVENT_NAME`

* It works exactly the same way as `mark_task` except for the fact that `unmark_task` marks a completed task as not completed.
* You may `unmark_task` a task when you realize that you have not completed the task but have wrongly marked it as completed.
* Errors will be raised if the specified task has already been unmarked.

Examples:
* `unmark_task td/Book Venue ev/NUS Career Fair 2023` marks the task `Book Venue` from the task list of the event `NUS Career Fair 2023` as not completed.

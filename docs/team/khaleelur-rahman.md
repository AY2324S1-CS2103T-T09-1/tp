### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Hereâ€™s an **overview** of how JobFestGo can help you with your event planning:
- Store information about your events and their associated contacts
- Track status of your event tasks
- Keep track of upcoming task deadlines
- Search for contacts by name or tag

With the advantages of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
and optimized for use with a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**,
it's a task management tool designed to help you, as a work festival event planner,
keep track of tasks and contacts unique to your events. JobFestGo streamlines the process of event planning,
supercharges productivity and helps you get things done on time.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=khaleelur-rahman&breakdown=true)

<br>

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  In charge of creating the bulk of the backend processes, along with changing hints of the model provided in AB3 to streamline to the product.

  <br>

  1) **Implemented the `add_tag` feature**
  - **What it does**: Allows the user to add tags (which are roles of the contact) into JobFestGo.
  - **Justification**: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to associate the contacts with their roles in the event.
  - **Highlights**: This enhancement adds a new command along with its classes to JobFestGo. This enhancement was challenging as there was a need to refactor certain parts of the JobFestGo model to enable association of contacts with only pre-existing tags.
  2) **Implemented the `delete_event` feature**
    - **What it does**: Allows the user to delete an event.
    - **Justification**: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to delete their events once completed or no longer needed.
  3) **Implemented the `add_task` feature**
    - **What it does**: Allows the user to create task for an event with a deadline.
    - **Justification**: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to keep track of the tasks for an event with ease.
    - **Highlights**: This enhancement adds a new command along with its classes to JobFestGo. This enhancement was extremely challenging as there was a need to implement the associated classes for both `tasks` and `events`. Multiple bugs arose due to the complexity of the implementation. However, after multiple debugging sessions, the feature was successfully implemented.

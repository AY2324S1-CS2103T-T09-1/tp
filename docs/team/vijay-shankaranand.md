### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners in Singapore to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Hereâ€™s an **overview** of how JobFestGo can help you with your event planning:
- Store information about your events and their associated contacts
- Track status of your event tasks
- Keep track of upcoming task deadlines
- Search for contacts by name or tag

Optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, it is a task management tool meant to assist you as a job festival event planner in tracking event-specific tasks and contacts. This removes the hassle of having to shuffle through your contact list based on names that you might not remember and organise your tasks according to events while obtaining your information **efficiently**.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    - Improved the `add_contact` feature
        - What it does: allows the user to add contacts into JobFestGo with optional tag.
        - Justification: Improved the feature to only allow tags that have already been added to JobFestGo for filter by tag feature.
    - Implemented the `add_event` feature
        - What it does: allows the user to add an event.
        - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to add their events to keep track of their upcoming/past events.
        - Highlights: This enhancement adds a new class to JobFestGo. This enhancement was challenging as there was a need to refactor certain parts of contact class to use for event class to minimize code duplication.
    - Implemented the reminder feature
        - What it does: reminds the users on tasks that are due within the next 3 days when they start up JobFestGo.
        - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to keep track of their upcoming tasks.
        - Highlights: Figuring out the logic to implement this feature was challenging as there was a need to check if the task is due within the next 3 days and if the task is not marked as done using a new predicate.

### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Hereâ€™s an **overview** of how JobFestGo can help you with your event planning:
- Store information about your events and their associated contacts
- Track status of your event tasks
- Keep track of upcoming task deadlines
- Search for contacts by name or tag

Optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, it is a task management tool meant to assist you as a job festival event planner in tracking event-specific tasks and contacts. This removes the hassle of having to shuffle through your contact list based on names that you might not remember and organise your tasks according to events while obtaining your information **efficiently**.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=rionshocker&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  - Implemented the `delete_tag` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to delete tags added to JobFestGo.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product as it gives the user a chance to delete tags that they might have mistakenly keyed in and would like to delete them.
  - Implemented the `select_event` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to select the event and view its respective contacts and tasks.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides the user with ease of viewing the tasks that needs to be handled in an event as well as contacts associated to the event.
    - Highlights: This enhancement touches on the UI component, to display that a particular event has been selected. The implementation was slightly challenging in view of the connection between frontend and backend implementation.
  - Handled the UI component of the project
    - Did up the MainWindow display of the application to have 3 columns, and ensuring that the flow of events followed by entering a command is valid.
  - In charge of linking backend implementations to frontend

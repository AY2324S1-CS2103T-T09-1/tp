### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a desktop address book application designed to aid job festival event organizers in efficiently reaching out to a multitude of contacts, including vendors and customers. It eliminates the need for organizers to sift through extensive contact lists, especially when they cannot recall specific names.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: to be added soon

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=xyt-t&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

* **Project management**:  to be added soon

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  - Implemented the `filter_by_tag` feature
      - What it does: allows the user to filter contacts in JobFestGo by their tags.
      - Justification: This feature improves user experience by enabling the user to quickly access specific groups of contacts, saving their time and effort.
  - Implemented the `link` and `unlink`feature
      - What it does: allows the user to associate contacts with specific event or undo the association.
      - Justification: This feature improves the product by providing the user with an additional way of organizing their network.
  - Implemented the `delete_task` feature
      - What it does: allows the user to delete tasks from their associated events in JobFestGo.
      - Justification: This feature is essential since the user may mistakenly add wrong tasks and would need to delete them.
  - Implemented the `mark_task` and `unmark_task` feature
      - What it does: allows the user to mark a task as completed or not completed in JobFestGo.
      - Justification: This feature improves user experience by enabling the user to easily track the progress of their tasks and plan their work accordingly.
